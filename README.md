<h1>Flutter Course Progress 🚀</h1>

Hi there! This is the repository for my ongoing Flutter development course. Here you'll find my progress and learnings as I work through the course materials and build various projects.

**Motivation:**

In the past, I attempted the 100 Days of Coding Challenge but unfortunately, I didn't reach my goal. This time, I'm taking a different approach and focusing on learning Flutter development in a structured way. I believe this will be a more effective and enjoyable way for me to acquire new skills and build practical applications.

**Project Goals:**

Through this course, I aim to:

* Master the fundamentals of Flutter development, including building widgets, understanding state management, and working with APIs.
* Develop a portfolio of various Flutter applications to showcase my skills and progress.
* Contribute to open-source projects and learn from other developers.
* Improve my problem-solving skills and become a more confident and efficient developer.

**Project Structure:**

This repository will be organized into different folders based on the course modules and projects I work on. Each folder will contain the relevant code files, assets, and documentation.

**Current Progress:**

I am currently on Flutter & Dart Basic 1 of the course and have completed 0 projects so far. You can find the details and source code for these projects in the corresponding folders.

**Future Plans:**

I plan to continue working through the Flutter course and share my progress regularly on this repository. I'm also open to collaborating on projects and receiving feedback from other developers.

**Additional Resources:**

* [Flutter course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps)
* [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
<!-- * [personal website](https://github.com/itsdwip) -->

**Feel free to:**

* Fork this repository and contribute to my projects.
* Open issues or pull requests if you have any feedback or suggestions.
* Connect with me on social media to discuss Flutter development and other tech topics.

Thank you for your interest and support!

Happy coding! 👩‍💻👨‍💻
